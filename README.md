## My name is ***Vahid*** and I'm a software developer.

Over the years I've done many projects in different platforms (Web/Mobile/Embedded). These days I mostly develop with web technologies such as `PHP`, `TS/JS` and `C#`. I really like working with data driven applications that process large sets of data and present it to the end user in an accessible way.
