## My name is ***Vahid*** and I'm a software developer.

#### Over the years I'v done many projects in different platforms (Web/Mobile/Embedded). These days I mostly develop with backend technologies such as `PHP` and `SQL`. I really like working with data driven applications that process large sets of data and present it to the end user in an accessible way.

##### Be sure to check out some of my open source projects such as [`veezee`](https://github.com/veezee) (the cross-platform music streamer)
