## My name is ***Vahid*** and I'm a software developer. 🐾

Over the years I've done many projects in different platforms (Web/Mobile/Embedded). These days I mostly develop with web technologies such as `PHP` with `Laravel`, `Vue` and `SQL`. I really like working with data driven applications that process large sets of data and present it to the end user in an accessible way.
